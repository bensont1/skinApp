Optional Implementation Tasks
1) implement multiple users - each with a different set of product lists
2) implement a pan gesture (or probably a screen edge pan gesture) to move between lists in the tab view
3) implement the detail view for each cell on the lists (include product name, brand, image, ingredients)
        -in the detail view, add the ability for the user to put in their own notes on the product that are saved to the cloud
4) implement the ability to allow user to create own lists to add to tab bar controller, and add products to those lists
5) implement way to move products between lists
6) implement user ratings for products on the current and favorite products lists, and organize the list by rating
7) organize lists by category (the app currently does not grab category data from the Factual data GET, but the information is there)
8) implement the ability to allow the user to reorder the current products list if they so choose (so they can order it by order of use)
9) implement ability to "track" skin
        -add ability to take picture in the app and save to a photo gallery with visible time stamp
        -potentially allow ability to caption photo, or save the current products at that moment with the photo, so the used products can be referenced with photo evidence at later date
